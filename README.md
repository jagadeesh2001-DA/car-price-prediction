# car-price-prediction
A machine learning project that predicts used car selling prices using Linear Regression. It analyzes factors like brand, vehicle age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and power to estimate accurate resale values and help users make informed pricing decisions.

# Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project builds a **Linear Regression model** to predict the selling price of used cars based on features such as brand, vehicle age, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, mileage, max power, and more. The model is trained, evaluated, and tested using real-world car dataset values.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Evaluation using RÂ² score and RMSE
- Visualization of model performance

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels
- Joblib (for model saving/loading)
